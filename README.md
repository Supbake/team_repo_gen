# Team Generator
  ## Description

  In this project I have created a way for a manager to list our their employees as a new or existing team to keep track of. I was able to do this using node.js. I created classes that were for each respective role; Manager, Engineer, as well as Interns. These cards were then created and placed into html cards to then be displayed for the manager to view. I included test files to see if my code was working properly.

  ## Installation

  You will need to run an npm i 'inquirer' as i used the dependencie. Then you will run node app.js to run the application for your role as manager and any subsequent team members you would like to add.

  ## Usage

   Managers would use this to keep track of their employees names, emails, employee id's, as well as office numbers for their locations. I also added special options for interns with which school they attended and for engineers their github repo will be listed.

  ## Credits

  I was able to work with a classmate Alex on this for a lot of my classes and tests. I used our activites as well as some googling for the rest. I was able to debug this from the help of my roommate Andrew. I used bootstrap for the card design and layout. also i was able to use Lorem Picsum for the pictures that are generated in the cards.
